### Overview
MarioRL utilizes a 3rd party extension of the Gymnasium API to simulate the original Super Mario Bros Game. I've implemented a Double Deep Q-Learning Algorithm in PyTorch to allow the agent to learn. To track training, I have also implemented Metric Loggers to generate graphs displaying the overall improvement in total rewards, minimizing loss, and other factors such as the length of the episode.
